# Documentation

Everything required to understand the creation and operation process of the project is stored in the documentation folder. Additionally, stuff like invoices for more serious projects are also stored in this folder. The subfolders contain images and other explanatory documents in the following scheme:

- [captures](captures/): Screenshots (CAD-Progress, quick captures, ... )
- [images](images/): Images taken by camera
- [invoices](invoices/): As the name suggests, for tracking of costs
- [sketches](sketches/): Any sketches of ideas and concepts

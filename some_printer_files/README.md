# Printer files

If a project has GCode-files being used to manufacture it, these printer files will be stored in an external repo in the [sn-printer-files](https://github.com/sn-printer-files/) organisation.

This makes it easy to manufacture multiple copies of the same project or to prepare an SD-card with the given files, as you just have to clone the repo onto the SD-card.
